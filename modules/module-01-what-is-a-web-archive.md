## Module One - Exploring Web Archives

### Exploring Web Archives

Each week we will try and learn about a new web archive, a web archiving tool, or a web archiving service.  The goal of this is to get an introduction to what is happening in the web archiving space, what is being collected, and who is collecting it. 

This week we will start off with the largest web archive that we have, the Internet Archives' Wayback Machine. 

https://web.archive.org/ 

We will learn more about the Internet Archive in future weeks.  For now, type a url into the Wayback Machine and see what you can find.  You could try https://unt.edu or maybe see what cnn.com looked like ten years ago. You can also try to view the different thumbnails that are rotating on the page.  Explore some of the features of the interface after you have selected a URL to explore.

## Module One - Discussion

### Discussion Post:

In at least one paragraph, discuss what you learned about web archiving in this week's introduction to the topic.  Were you familiar with this area before this course? Have you ever found yourself using a web archive in your research or work? Knowing that there are web archives, how do you think they might be useful in your work in the future?  Finally, if there was something that didn't get answered in the readings, or if a question came up that you would like to hear others ideas on, please include that in your post.

In at least one paragraph, discuss what you learned about the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. What URLs did you look at? Were you surprised by anything that you found? What is your previous experience with the Wayback Machine?

### Class Engagement: 

After you have made the discussion post described above, take the time to response, comment, or engage with at least two of your classmates posts.  

If there are any unanswered questions feel free to try and offer an answer or suggestion to the original poster.  Did they mention something that made you investigate something further? If so, what was it?
